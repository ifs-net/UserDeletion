Once installed users will be able to delete their own accounts.

You will use this script at your own risk! 
Sometimes using this module will cause errors in other modules 
because they try to find user data that does not exist any more.

If you - as admin - want to delete users, please use the UserDeletion
admin interface. Do not use the admin interface of the Users module 
any more!

If you are a module developer and you want userdeletion to include
your module in the deletion process take a look into the 
pnuserdeletion.php file. Customize the file for the needs of your 
module and place it in your modules folder.
If there is a deletion request, all the pnuserdeletion.php files
in all module directories will be used.

You do not have to write some deletion routines in this file, you
can also choose to anonymize the data.

The return of the function in this file is an array that will be 
used in the output the user or an administrator will see.

And - I cannot say this enoug times - DO NOT TRY THE DELETION 
ROUTING WITH YOUR ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT! I WILL NOT ANSWER EMAILS
LIKE "FU** I DELETED MY ADMIN ACCOUNT AND CANNOT LOGIN AS ADMIN 
ANY MORE" ANY MORE! ;-)

Have a lot of fun!
